# Flappy Bird in SDL2
"Flappy Bird" made in C++ with SDL2.
I made this for as a quick project to learn SDL2 with C++. I included the CMake lists in this repository, so you can compile it. You will have to edit the CMake lists file to set the include and library directories for SDL to the correct location. I used Mingw-w64 to compile.
